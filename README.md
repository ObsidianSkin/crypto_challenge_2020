Solve this challenge to maybe win something. Due by next meeting (but you could always do it for fun).

<b>Implement repeating-key XOR<\b>

What does that mean? In repeating-key XOR, you'll sequentially apply each byte of the key. Let's say our key is "ICE"; the first byte of plaintext will be XOR'd against I, the next C, the next E, then I again for the 4th byte, and so on. Here's an example:

Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
